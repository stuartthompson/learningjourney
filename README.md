# Learning Journey

A text adventure focused on early years educational challenges designed to encourage children to practice reading, reasoning, and leverage problem solving and creative thinking to tackle a series of challenges.

I am writing this for my daughter, Rowen, to provide a new opportunity for her to engage with her learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is assembled with love in the hopes that it inspires her to continue learning, growing, and challenging herself to think.

## Structure

As part of my own continued education I'm teaching myself the Rust programming language. This project gives a great opporuntity to both practice my skills and build a new experience for my daughter.
